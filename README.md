# Javascript Practice Site

This website was created as a project for a javascript class that I took at Pasadena City College. It features three javascript elements: a pop-up modal contact form, two intersection observers, and a counter.
The counter is meant to act like it's counting a number of items as they are given away. So, it increments upwards, but at an uneven rate.
